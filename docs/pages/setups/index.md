Function Mocker is not a testing framework but merely a testing tool meant to be used in the context of a fully-fledged testing framework.  
Here are some examples of how to set up a testing project using different and supported frameworks:

* [PHPUnit](/setups/phpunit.html) - how to setup Function Mocker to be used in a simple PHPUnit project

If the framework you would like to use is not listed it probably means just that I've forgotten to list it and not that Function Mocker could not work with it.  
Please report a missing framework in an issue on the repository and let me know if you could not make Function Mocker work.
