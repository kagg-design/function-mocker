Function Mocker is part of my efforts to make [WordPress][9997-0001] testing easier to approach, implement and maintain.  
It's a testing framework agnostic function mocking library based on [Patchwork][9997-0002] to stub, mock and spy PHP functions in tests without requiring any additional PHP extension.  

Site built Jekyll:
